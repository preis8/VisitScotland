          <div>
            <p>Shrouded in myth and legend, Scotland's beautiful Loch Ness remains one of the country's top places to visit. Despite there being no definitive evidence that "Nessie," the world's most famous sea monster, actually exists, that first glimpse of the water doesn't stop excited tourists from scanning the horizon excitedly... just in case.</p>
            <p>Expect to spend at least a day exploring the old castle and other Loch Ness attractions. Other fun things to do include a boat cruise along the loch and, if there's time, the Caledonian Canal, which connects Scotland's east and west coasts.</p>

            <p>The attractive west coast resort town of Fort William makes an excellent starting point for excursions into the unspoiled Highlands, including Ben Nevis. Located at the south end of the Caledonian Canal, Fort William - named after fortifications built here in the 17th century - offers visitors plenty of points of interest to explore, including the West Highland Museum in Cameron Square, notable for its collections of furniture, paintings, weapons, and Highland costumes.</p>
            <p> A great excursion from Fort William is to Glenfinnan Viaduct, often  recognized  from  numerous  Harry Potter  movies (among other

              <p>films) as the route the Hogwart Express took when whisking young wizards to school. Fun steam excursions can be enjoyed aboard the lovely Jacobite steam train along this stretch of the West Highland Line, taking in the viaduct and some of the most scenic vistas found anywhere in Scotland. From Fort William, you can also easily get to other popular Scotland destinations, including Glencoe, a spectacular valley famed for its breathtaking scenery, winter sports, hiking, and mountain climbing.</p>

            <p>Few travel destinations have captured the imagination to the extent of the magnificent Scottish Highlands. Stretching from the attractive garden city of Inverness on the country's rugged east coast all the way to John O'Groats in the north, this area of outstanding natural beauty is where you'll find some of the most romantic scenery anywhere - it has served as the backdrop to hit movies and TV shows, including the hugely popular Outlander series.</p>
            <p>A great option for those planning on driving is to travel along the North Coast 500.</p>

            <p>If you're only able to visit one city in Scotland, make it Edinburgh. The country's capital is home to well-preserved architecture from a number of different periods of history, including medieval times (Edinburgh Castle and the incredible shop-lined Royal Mile), to the more recent New Town area, much of which was built in the 18thcentury. A highlight of this newer part of the ancient city is simply wandering among the many elegant Georgian townhomes, taking in the Grassmarket, an attractive pedestrian-friendly public square popular for its shops, galleries, and caf√©s.</p>

          <div class="sectionTitle">Island of Skye</div>
          <div>
            <p>Another Scottish island to explore is the lovely Isle of Skye. Like Arran, it boasts a little something of everything that is Scotland but with the advantage that it's connected to the mainland via road bridge. Part of the Hebrides in the northwest section of the Highlands, this large island is some 80 kilometers in length and is a nature-lover's paradise, home to colonies of seabirds, seals, and other native wildlife, along with mile after mile of rugged coastline and spectacular hill views.</p>
            <p>Hikers and hillwalkers in particular are well-catered to, thanks to the island's extensive trail networks, which lead across romantic moors and valleys and up mountains, including the Cuillin Hills, which boast some of the best views in Scotland.</p>

              <p>Man-made attractions include the attractive Armadale Castle. Located near the ferry port of Mallaig, this early 19th-century edifice is set in the heart of a huge country estate and features excellent displays and artifacts related to one of the most powerful of Scotland's historic clans, the Donalds. Expect to easily spend a few hours exploring the large grounds and gardens with their walking trails, as well as the Museum of the Isles. Also worth a visit is Dunvegan Castle, once the seat of the MacLeod clan, located in the village of the same name and a great place to embark on a boat tour or fishing excursion.</p>

          <div class="sectionTitle">Glasgow</div>
          <div>
            <p>Situated on the River Clyde on Scotland's west coast, the city of Glasgow has, in the last few decades, reimagined itself as a major European cultural center, using its many excellent museums, art galleries, and festivals to attract tourists year-round. It's a great city to explore on foot thanks to its many lovely parks and pedestrian-friendly streets, especially if you also take in Glasgow cathedral and the famous Glasgow School of Art. </p>
            <p>After exploring the city center, head down to the waterfront and the Riverside Museum. One of the top free things to do in Glasgow, this superb modern facility focuses on the history of transportation in the city through its large collections of vintage steam engines, trams, buses, carriages, cars, and seafaring</p>

            <p>vessels, along with an authentic reproduction of 1930s shops and homes.</p>
            <p>Glasgow has also earned a reputation for other cultural activities, too. Highlights for theatergoers include a chance to take in a play at the King's Theatre, partake in a little opera at the home of the Scottish Opera in the Theatre Royal, or a classical concert at the Royal Scottish Orchestra at the Concert Hall. Other notable arts-related attractions include the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, notable for its displays of local art, and the wonderful Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Glasgow Style Gallery with its diverse collection that includes works by Van Gogh and Salvador Dali.</p>

            <p>The historic town of Stirling is one of the best places in Scotland to serve as a base from which to explore the country: it's situated almost half way between Glasgow and Edinburgh, so it makes for a great day trip and boasts plenty of great things to see and do. Topping the list is stunning Stirling Castle, famous for once having been a royal palace (Mary Queen of Scots spent her childhood here), as well as its role in the centuries-long struggle between Scotland and England. A visit to this "mini-Edinburgh Castle" includes a chance to explore the well-preserved medieval structure's grand halls and rooms, either on your own or as part of a guided tour.</p>
